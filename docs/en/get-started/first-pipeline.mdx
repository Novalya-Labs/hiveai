# Your First Pipeline

Learn how to build a multi-agent pipeline where agents work together sequentially.

## What You'll Build

A 3-agent research pipeline that:
1. **Researcher** - Finds information about a topic
2. **Analyzer** - Extracts insights from the research
3. **Reporter** - Creates a final report combining all findings

```
Researcher → Analyzer → Reporter
```

## Step 1: Create the Team

```bash
mkdir -p teams/research-pipeline
cd teams/research-pipeline
```

## Step 2: Create Agent 1 - Researcher

Create `1-researcher.yml`:

```yaml teams/research-pipeline/1-researcher.yml
name: topic-researcher
description: "Researches a topic and identifies key themes"

llm:
  provider: mistral
  temperature: 0.5
  max_tokens: 1500

prompts:
  system: "You are a research analyst specialized in identifying key themes."
  user: |
    Analyze the topic of "AI Agent Orchestration" and identify:
    1. Key concepts
    2. Main use cases
    3. Challenges
    
    Return JSON format with:
    - concepts: array of concepts
    - use_cases: array of use cases
    - challenges: array of challenges

goals:
  - Identify key themes
  - Provide structured analysis

tasks:
  - Analyze the topic
  - Extract key concepts
```

<Info>
  This agent has **no dependencies** - it runs first.
</Info>

## Step 3: Create Agent 2 - Analyzer

Create `2-analyzer.yml`:

```yaml teams/research-pipeline/2-analyzer.yml
name: insight-extractor
description: "Extracts actionable insights from research"

depends_on: topic-researcher  # 👈 Waits for researcher

llm:
  provider: mistral
  temperature: 0.6
  max_tokens: 2000

prompts:
  system: "You are a strategic analyst who extracts actionable insights."
  user: |
    Based on the research provided, extract:
    1. Top 3 opportunities
    2. Top 3 risks
    3. Priority focus areas
    
    Return JSON with:
    - opportunities: array
    - risks: array
    - priorities: array

goals:
  - Extract actionable insights
  - Identify opportunities and risks

tasks:
  - Analyze research results
  - Extract opportunities
  - Identify risks
```

<Tip>
  The `depends_on` field tells HiveAI to wait for `topic-researcher` to complete.
  The researcher's results are **automatically injected** into this agent's prompt!
</Tip>

## Step 4: Create Agent 3 - Reporter

Create `3-reporter.yml`:

```yaml teams/research-pipeline/3-reporter.yml
name: report-synthesizer
description: "Creates final synthesis report"

depends_on:
  - topic-researcher
  - insight-extractor  # 👈 Multiple dependencies

llm:
  provider: mistral
  temperature: 0.4
  max_tokens: 2500

prompts:
  system: "You are a senior analyst who creates comprehensive reports."
  user: |
    Create a synthesis report combining:
    - Initial research findings
    - Extracted insights
    
    Include:
    1. Executive Summary
    2. Key Findings
    3. Recommendations
    4. Next Steps
    
    Return JSON with these fields.

goals:
  - Create comprehensive report
  - Combine all insights

tasks:
  - Review all outputs
  - Synthesize findings
  - Create recommendations

output_result: final-report.json  # 👈 Custom output filename
```

<Check>
  This agent depends on **both** previous agents and will receive their results automatically!
</Check>

## Step 5: Run the Pipeline

```bash
npx hiveai run research-pipeline
```

Watch the magic happen:

```
🚀 Starting pipeline with 3 agent(s)...

[1/3] 🤖 Running agent: topic-researcher
   📝 Researches a topic and identifies key themes
   🧠 LLM: mistral (mistral-large-latest)
   📨 Sending prompt (279 chars)...
   ✅ Completed in 22.7s

[2/3] 🤖 Running agent: insight-extractor
   Dependencies: topic-researcher
   📦 Loaded results from: topic-researcher  # 👈 Automatic!
   📨 Sending prompt (10491 chars)...
   ✅ Completed in 36.9s

[3/3] 🤖 Running agent: report-synthesizer
   Dependencies: topic-researcher, insight-extractor
   📦 Loaded results from: topic-researcher, insight-extractor  # 👈 Both!
   📨 Sending prompt (25031 chars)...
   💾 Output saved → final-report.json
   ✅ Completed in 32.6s

============================================================
📊 Pipeline Summary
============================================================
Total agents: 3
✅ Successful: 3
⏱️  Total duration: 92.2s
============================================================
```

## Step 6: Check the Results

```bash
ls teams/research-pipeline/output/
# final-report.json
# topic-researcher.json
# insight-extractor.json
```

View the final report:
```bash
cat teams/research-pipeline/output/final-report.json
```

## How It Works

### 1. Dependency Resolution

HiveAI automatically figures out the execution order:

```
topic-researcher (no deps)
    ↓
insight-extractor (depends_on: topic-researcher)
    ↓
report-synthesizer (depends_on: [topic-researcher, insight-extractor])
```

### 2. Automatic Data Injection

When `insight-extractor` runs, its prompt automatically includes:

```
Results from previous agents:

### topic-researcher:
{
  "concepts": [...],
  "use_cases": [...],
  "challenges": [...]
}

[Your custom prompt continues...]
```

### 3. Shared Memory

All results are stored in `cache.json` for the entire pipeline session.

## Advanced Patterns

### Multiple Dependencies

```yaml
depends_on:
  - agent-1
  - agent-2
  - agent-3  # Waits for all three
```

### Error Handling

```yaml
name: resilient-agent
on_error: continue  # 👈 Don't stop pipeline if this fails
```

### Environment Variables

```yaml
prompts:
  user: "Analyze {{COMPANY_NAME}} in {{REGION}}"  # From .env
```
