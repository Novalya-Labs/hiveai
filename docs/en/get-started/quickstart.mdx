# Quickstart

Build your first HiveAI agent in less than 5 minutes.

<Info>
  **Prerequisites:** Make sure you've completed the [Installation](/docs/en/get-started/installation) guide.
</Info>

## Step 1: Create a Team Directory

```bash
mkdir -p teams/my-first-team
cd teams/my-first-team
```

## Step 2: Create Your First Agent

Create a file named `analyst.yml`:

```yaml teams/my-first-team/analyst.yml
name: market-analyst
description: "Analyzes market trends"

llm:
  provider: mistral
  temperature: 0.7
  max_tokens: 1500

prompts:
  system: "You are a market analyst providing clear, data-driven insights."
  user: |
    Analyze the current state of AI technology market.
    Focus on:
    1. Key trends
    2. Major players
    3. Future predictions
    
    Return your analysis in JSON format with these fields:
    - trends: array of key trends
    - players: array of major companies
    - predictions: array of future predictions

goals:
  - Analyze AI market trends
  - Identify key players
  - Make predictions

tasks:
  - Research current market state
  - Extract key insights
  - Format as structured data
```

<Tip>
  You don't need any tools for this first agent - it will use pure LLM reasoning.
</Tip>

## Step 3: Run Your Agent

```bash
npx hiveai run my-first-team
```

You should see output like this:

```
🚀 Starting pipeline with 1 agent(s)...

[1/1] 🤖 Running agent: market-analyst
   📝 Analyzes market trends
   🧠 LLM: mistral (mistral-large-latest)
      Temperature: 0.7
      Max tokens: 1500
   📨 Sending prompt (234 chars)...
      → Calling Mistral API (attempt 1/3)...
      ✓ Response received (2847 chars)
   💾 Output saved → market-analyst.json
   ✅ Completed in 12.4s

============================================================
📊 Pipeline Summary
============================================================
Total agents: 1
✅ Successful: 1
❌ Failed: 0
⏱️  Total duration: 12.4s
============================================================
```

## Step 4: Check the Results

Your results are saved in `teams/my-first-team/output/market-analyst.json`:

```bash
cat teams/my-first-team/output/market-analyst.json
```

```json
{
  "content": "{\n  \"trends\": [\n    \"Generative AI adoption\",\n    \"AI in healthcare\",\n    \"Autonomous systems\"\n  ],\n  \"players\": [\n    \"OpenAI\",\n    \"Google DeepMind\",\n    \"Anthropic\"\n  ],\n  \"predictions\": [\n    \"AI agents will become mainstream\",\n    \"Regulation will increase\",\n    \"Cost of AI will decrease\"\n  ]\n}",
  "toolCalls": []
}
```

## What Just Happened?

1. **HiveAI loaded** your agent configuration from YAML
2. **Orchestrator** prepared the execution environment
3. **Mistral AI** processed your prompt with custom temperature/tokens
4. **Result** was saved as JSON in the output folder

## Try Different LLMs

      provider: openai
      model: gpt-4o-mini
      temperature: 0.8
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Anthropic (Claude)">
    ```yaml

## Common Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="API Key Not Found">
    Make sure your `.env` file contains the correct API key:
    ```bash
    echo $MISTRAL_API_KEY  # Should output your key
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="YAML Parse Error">
    Check indentation - YAML uses 2 spaces, not tabs:
    ```yaml
    # ✅ Correct
    llm:
      provider: mistral
    
    # ❌ Wrong (tab instead of spaces)
    llm:
    	provider: mistral
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Agent Not Found">
    Verify your directory structure:
    ```bash
    ls teams/my-first-team/*.yml  # Should list your agent
    ```
  </Accordion>
