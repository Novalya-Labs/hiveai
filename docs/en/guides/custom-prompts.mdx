# Custom Prompts

Learn how to write effective prompts for your agents.

## Anatomy of a Prompt

```yaml
prompts:
  system: |
    You are a specialized data analyst with expertise in market research.
    You provide clear, data-driven insights with actionable recommendations.
    Always return structured JSON output.
  
  user: |
    Analyze the following market: {{MARKET_NAME}}
    
    Focus on:
    1. Market size and growth
    2. Key players and market share
    3. Trends and opportunities
    
    Return JSON with:
    - market_size: string
    - growth_rate: number
    - key_players: array
    - trends: array
```

## System Prompt

**Purpose:** Define role, behavior, and expertise

### Good Examples

```yaml
# Data Analyst
system: "You are a senior data analyst with 10 years of experience in statistical analysis. You provide clear insights backed by data."

# Creative Writer
system: "You are a creative copywriter specializing in engaging, conversational content. Use storytelling and vivid language."

# Technical Expert
system: "You are a technical architect who explains complex systems clearly. Use diagrams and examples."
```

## User Prompt

**Purpose:** Specific task instructions

### Best Practices

1. **Be specific**: Instead of "analyze data", say "identify top 3 trends in Q4 sales"
2. **Structure output**: Tell the LLM what format you want
3. **Use examples**: Show the desired output format
4. **Set constraints**: Word limits, format requirements, etc.

### Template Example

```yaml
user: |
  Task: {{TASK_TYPE}}
  Data Source: {{DATA_SOURCE}}
  Output Format: JSON
  
  Requirements:
  1. Focus on {{FOCUS_AREA}}
  2. Include quantitative metrics
  3. Provide 3-5 recommendations
  
  Expected Output:
  {
    "summary": "string",
    "metrics": {},
    "recommendations": []
  }
```

## Environment Variables

Reference `.env` variables with `{{VAR_NAME}}`:

```yaml
prompts:
  user: "Analyze {{COMPANY}} in {{REGION}} market"
```

```bash
# .env
COMPANY=Tesla
REGION=Europe
```

Result: "Analyze Tesla in Europe market"

## Auto-Generated Prompts

If you don't specify custom prompts, HiveAI generates:

```
You are an autonomous agent executing a defined mission.

You have access to these tools:
- firecrawl: Use it to scrape and extract clean content from any website URL
- file-reader: Use it to read and parse files (JSON, CSV, TXT, MD)

Goals: Extract key insights; Analyze trends
Tasks: Scrape competitor websites; Parse data files
Return structured JSON output.
```

## Prompt Engineering Tips

### 1. JSON Output

```yaml
user: |
  Analyze the data and return JSON ONLY (no markdown, no explanation):
  {
    "insights": [],
    "confidence": 0.0-1.0
  }
```

### 2. Chain of Thought

```yaml
user: |
  Think step by step:
  1. Analyze the data
  2. Identify patterns
  3. Form conclusions
  4. Provide recommendations
```

### 3. Few-Shot Examples

```yaml
user: |
  Extract entities from text.
  
  Example 1:
  Input: "Apple released iPhone in Cupertino"
  Output: {"company": "Apple", "product": "iPhone", "location": "Cupertino"}
  
  Example 2:
  Input: "Tesla opened factory in Berlin"
  Output: {"company": "Tesla", "facility": "factory", "location": "Berlin"}
  
  Now extract from: {{INPUT_TEXT}}
```

### 4. Role + Context

```yaml
system: |
  Role: Senior Financial Analyst at Goldman Sachs
  Expertise: Tech sector valuations
  Audience: C-level executives
  Tone: Professional, data-driven
```

## Common Mistakes

<Warning>
**Avoid:**
- Too vague: "analyze this"
- Too long: 1000+ word prompts
- No structure: Free-form requests
- Conflicting instructions
</Warning>

## Testing Prompts

1. **Start simple**: Test with basic prompt
2. **Add structure**: Refine output format
3. **Add constraints**: Temperature, length
4. **Iterate**: Based on results
