# Error Handling

Build robust pipelines that handle failures gracefully.

## Default Behavior

By default, pipelines **stop on first error**:

```
Agent 1 ✅ Success
Agent 2 ❌ Failed
Agent 3 ⏭️  Skipped (not run)
```

## Continue on Error

```yaml
name: optional-analytics
on_error: continue  # Don't stop pipeline
```

Result:
```
Agent 1 ✅ Success
Agent 2 ❌ Failed (on_error: continue)
Agent 3 ✅ Success (runs anyway)
```

## Retry Logic

All LLM calls have **automatic retry** (3 attempts):
- Exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 3s)
- Works for all providers (OpenAI, Claude, Mistral)

## Error Messages

Clear errors from HiveAI:

```
❌ Failed: Mistral API failed after 3 attempts: 401 Unauthorized

Check your MISTRAL_API_KEY in .env file
```

## Best Practices

<Check>**DO:**</Check>
- Use `on_error: continue` for optional steps
- Test agents individually first
- Monitor error logs
- Have fallback agents

<Warning>**DON'T:**</Warning>
- Ignore errors silently
- Assume all agents will succeed
- Skip error testing
