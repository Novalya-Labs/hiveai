# Research Pipeline Example

A real-world example: **3 agents collaborate** to research, analyze, and report.

## Overview

- **Agent 1**: Researcher - Finds information
- **Agent 2**: Analyzer - Extracts insights
- **Agent 3**: Reporter - Creates final report

**Total time**: ~92 seconds | **Result**: Comprehensive research report

## Setup

```bash
mkdir -p teams/research-pipeline
cd teams/research-pipeline
```

## Agent 1: Researcher

```yaml
name: topic-researcher
description: "Researches a topic and identifies key themes"

llm:
  provider: mistral
  temperature: 0.5
  max_tokens: 1500

prompts:
  system: "You are a research analyst specialized in identifying key themes."
  user: |
    Analyze the topic of "AI Agent Orchestration".
    Return JSON with: concepts, use_cases, challenges

goals:
  - Identify key themes
tasks:
  - Analyze the topic
  - Extract key concepts
```

## Agent 2: Analyzer

```yaml
name: insight-extractor
depends_on: topic-researcher  # Waits for researcher

llm:
  provider: mistral
  temperature: 0.6
  max_tokens: 2000

prompts:
  system: "You are a strategic analyst."
  user: |
    Extract from the research:
    1. Top 3 opportunities
    2. Top 3 risks
    3. Priority areas
    
    Return JSON format.

goals:
  - Extract actionable insights
tasks:
  - Analyze research
  - Identify opportunities
```

## Agent 3: Reporter

```yaml
name: report-synthesizer
depends_on:
  - topic-researcher
  - insight-extractor  # Multiple dependencies!

llm:
  provider: mistral
  temperature: 0.4
  max_tokens: 2500

prompts:
  system: "You are a senior analyst."
  user: |
    Create synthesis report with:
    1. Executive Summary
    2. Key Findings
    3. Recommendations
    4. Next Steps

goals:
  - Create comprehensive report
tasks:
  - Synthesize all findings

output_result: final-research-report.json
```

## Run It

```bash
npx hiveai run research-pipeline
```

Output:
```

## Results

Check `teams/research-pipeline/output/`:
- `topic-researcher.json`
- `insight-extractor.json`
- `final-research-report.json` ← Final report!

## Key Takeaways

1. **Dependencies work** - Agents wait for each other
2. **Results auto-inject** - No manual data passing
3. **Multi-LLM** - All Mistral, but could mix providers
4. **Structured output** - JSON format throughout

## Try It Yourself

Modify the prompts to research YOUR topic:

```yaml
prompts:
  user: |
    Analyze the topic of "{{YOUR_TOPIC}}"
```

Then run: `npx hiveai run research-pipeline`
