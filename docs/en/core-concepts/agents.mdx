# Agents

Agents are the **core building blocks** of HiveAI. Each agent is an autonomous entity with its own LLM, tools, goals, and tasks.

## What is an Agent?

An agent is defined by:

1. **Identity**: Name and description
2. **Brain**: LLM configuration (provider, model, temperature)
3. **Capabilities**: Tools it can use
4. **Purpose**: Goals to achieve
5. **Actions**: Tasks to execute
6. **Dependencies**: Other agents it relies on

## Agent Lifecycle

```
1. Load configuration (YAML)
   ↓
2. Validate schema
   ↓
3. Wait for dependencies (if any)
   ↓
4. Build prompt (goals + tasks + tools)
   ↓
5. Call LLM
   ↓
6. Execute tool calls (if any)
   ↓
7. Return result
   ↓
8. Store in memory
```

## Basic Agent

```yaml
name: analyst
llm: mistral
goals:
  - Analyze market trends
tasks:
  - Extract key insights from data
```

That's the minimum! HiveAI handles the rest.

## Advanced Agent

```yaml
name: research-agent
description: "Specialized agent for market research"

llm:
  provider: openai
  model: gpt-4o-mini
  temperature: 0.7
  max_tokens: 2000

prompts:
  system: "You are a senior market analyst"
  user: "Research {{TOPIC}} and provide insights"

tools:
  - firecrawl
  - file-reader

goals:
  - Extract key information from websites
  - Analyze competitor data

tasks:
  - Scrape competitor websites
  - Parse data files
  - Synthesize findings

depends_on: data-collector
output_result: research-report.json
on_error: continue
```

## Agent Types

### 1. Independent Agent

No dependencies, runs first:

```yaml
name: data-collector
llm: mistral
goals: [Collect data]
tasks: [Scrape sources]
```

### 2. Dependent Agent

Waits for other agents:

```yaml
name: analyzer
depends_on: data-collector  # Waits for data-collector
goals: [Analyze collected data]
```

### 3. Convergence Agent

Waits for multiple agents:

```yaml
name: synthesizer
depends_on:
  - data-collector
  - analyzer
  - validator
goals: [Create final report]
```

## Agent Communication

Agents communicate through **shared memory**:

```
Agent 1 (researcher)
  ↓ saves result
Memory
  ↓ injects result
Agent 2 (analyzer)
```

The analyzer automatically receives:

```
Results from previous agents:

### researcher:
{
  "findings": [...],
  "insights": [...]
}

[Analyzer's custom prompt continues...]
```

## Goals vs Tasks

| Goals | Tasks |
|-------|-------|
| **What** to achieve | **How** to achieve it |
| High-level outcomes | Concrete actions |
| "Analyze trends" | "Parse CSV files" |
| "Extract insights" | "Call API endpoints" |

Both are included in the agent's prompt to guide the LLM.

## Agent Configuration

Full reference: [Agent Configuration Guide](/docs/en/guides/agent-configuration)

Key fields:

- `name`: Unique identifier (required)
- `llm`: LLM configuration (required)
- `goals`: What to achieve (required, min 1)
- `tasks`: How to do it (required, min 1)
- `description`: Agent description (optional)
- `prompts`: Custom system/user prompts (optional)
- `tools`: Tool names (optional)
- `depends_on`: Dependencies (optional)
- `output_result`: Custom output file (optional)
- `on_error`: Error behavior (optional, `stop` or `continue`)

## Best Practices

<Check>**DO:**</Check>
- Keep agents focused on one responsibility
- Use descriptive names
- Define clear goals and tasks
- Test agents independently before chaining
- Use appropriate temperature for task type

<Warning>**DON'T:**</Warning>
- Make agents do too many things
- Forget required fields (name, llm, goals, tasks)
- Create circular dependencies
- Use tabs in YAML (use 2 spaces)

## Agent Output

Agents save results to:

```
teams/your-team/output/
  ├── agent-1.json
  ├── agent-2.json
  └── agent-3.json
```

Each file contains:

```json
{
  "content": "Agent's main response",
  "toolCalls": [
    {
      "name": "file-reader",
      "input": {...},
      "result": {...}
    }
  ]
}
```

<Note>
**Quick tip**: Start with a simple agent (just name, llm, goals, tasks) and add complexity gradually as you learn what works.
